\chapter*{Foreword}

These are course notes for a one-semester third-year course on categories and modules taught at the University of Amsterdam. 

\section*{Prerequisites}

Linear algebra, groups, elementary point-set topology, and the basics of rings and fields. Several exercises and  examples in the parts about categories refer to basic concepts in algebraic topology, Galois theory, or representation theory. Although in principle these can be skipped, developing a rich vocabulary of natural  examples is probably the most important aspect of becoming acquainted with categories.


\section*{Other sources}

Excellent alternative sources for much of the material in this course are the concise but clear and well-written Atiyah \& MacDonald \cite{AtiyahMacDonald}, the more lengthy Lang \cite{Lang}, the course notes by Moerdijk \cite{Moerdijk} and (in Dutch) the Algebra 2 course notes by Stevenhagen \cite{Stevenhagen}. A good introduction in the language of categories and functors containing much more than these notes is \cite{Leinster}.
